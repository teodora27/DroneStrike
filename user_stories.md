## 1. Autonomous Indoor Navigation
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want the drone to autonomously navigate indoors and avoid obstacles, ensuring it safely reaches the target area._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The drone detects and avoids obstacles in real time.
- The drone follows a predefined or dynamically generated path to the target area.
- Safety protocols are implemented for collision avoidance.

## 2. Object Recognition for Personal Items
**User Story:**  
_As a forgetful user, I want the drone to automatically detect and locate my keys so that I don’t waste time searching for them._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The drone uses computer vision to recognize keys.
- The system supports updating or adding new objects for recognition.
- The recognition process is fast and reliable.

## 3. Object Detection Notification and Imaging
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want the drone to notify me when it finds the target object and capture a high-resolution image for confirmation._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system sends a notification upon object detection.
- The drone captures and stores an image of the object.
- The captured image is accessible via the user interface.

## 4. Manual Control Override
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want to manually override the drone’s autonomous navigation to maintain control in critical situations._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A user-friendly manual control interface is available.
- The system allows smooth switching between autonomous and manual modes.
- Safety mechanisms are in place during manual override.

## 5. Real-Time Video Feed
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want to view a real-time video feed from the drone’s camera to monitor its search progress._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A live video stream is available on the user’s device.
- The video quality is sufficient for detailed monitoring.
- The stream has minimal latency.

---

## 6. Obstacle Encounter Alerts
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want the drone to alert me when it encounters an obstacle it cannot navigate around so that I can take manual control if necessary._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The drone detects obstacles that are too challenging to avoid autonomously.
- An immediate alert is sent to the user.
- The user can promptly switch to manual control upon receiving the alert.

---

## 7. Customizable Object Input
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want to provide a description or a reference image of the target object to guide the drone’s search._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The interface allows users to enter a text description or upload an image.
- The drone’s object recognition system adapts to the provided input.
- Feedback is provided if the input does not match available detection parameters.

---

## 8. Post-Task Summary Report
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want the drone to generate a summary report after completing its search, detailing its efficiency and accuracy._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The report includes metrics such as time taken, path efficiency, and detection accuracy.
- The summary is accessible through the user interface.
- The report is stored for future reference and analysis.

---

## 9. Automated Return to Base
**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want the drone to automatically return to its starting position after completing its task, ensuring easy retrieval._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The drone is equipped with a reliable return-to-home feature.
- The drone safely navigates back without user intervention.
- The system confirms successful return upon task completion.

---

## 10. Advanced Object Detection for Misplaced Items
**User Story:**  
_As a user concerned about misplaced sunglasses, I want the drone’s advanced object detection to confirm whether they were on my head all along._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The drone distinguishes between various objects and their locations.
- The system provides visual confirmation (photos or video) of the detection.
- Accuracy is maintained even in challenging lighting or cluttered environments.

---

## 11. Navigation in Cluttered Environments
**User Story:**  
_As a user who dislikes cleaning, I want the drone to navigate through the cluttered environment of my floor so that I don’t have to manually organize it._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The drone effectively maps and navigates complex, cluttered spaces.
- It safely avoids dynamic obstacles (e.g., furniture, toys).
- The system demonstrates robust performance in real-life clutter scenarios.
